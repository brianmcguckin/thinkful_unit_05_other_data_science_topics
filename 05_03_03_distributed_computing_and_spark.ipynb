    "## Distributed Computing and Spark\n",
    "- Using standard tools on big data translates to slow analysis & modeling\n",
    "- Big data also has its own tools/techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicore Computing\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: packages like sklearn have n_jobs option to set the number of cores to utilize when training model\n",
    "    - Trains on multiple cores simultaneously\n",
    "    - Theoretically, processing time is divided by the number of cores (2 cores over 1 = half the time to train)\n",
    "- Some models are easier to parallelize than others but most can be parallelized in some way\n",
    "    - Random forest: different cores generate different trees\n",
    "    - Boosted trees: as trees split, subsequent models run in different cores\n",
    "    - SVM doesn't parallelize well, uses memory for points near margins\n",
    "\n",
    "### SPARK\n",
    "- Training/running models locally is often out of the question\n",
    "    - Too much data\n",
    "    - Too long to train\n",
    "- Spark: distributed computing tool from the Apache suite built up around hadoop\n",
    "    - PySpark: python like syntax for Spark making it easy to translate python to spark\n",
    "        - Looks nearly identical to python\n",
    "        - Requires infrastructure set up to run\n",
    "    - There also Spark versions of iPython/Jupyter notebooks and SKLearn"
