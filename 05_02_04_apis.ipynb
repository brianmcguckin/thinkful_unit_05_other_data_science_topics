    "## Anatomy of an API\n",
    "**API**: Application programming interface\n",
    "- Most 'big' sites (Twitter, Google, etc) have APIs to access their information\n",
    "    - Allows access to information without using webpages\n",
    "    - Can as the server to send only the specific information desired\n",
    "    - Speeds up scraping as well as minimizes server demand\n",
    "    - Typically includes throttling by limiting number of server requests per hour\n",
    "- Access: request a key that program provides with each API call\n",
    "    - API key (or token) uniquely identifies you\n",
    "    - Lets the API provider monitor your usage\n",
    "    - Security measure:keys can have different levels of authorization/access\n",
    "    - Can be set to expire after a certain amount of time or number of uses\n",
    "- Requests: program requests the data with a call to the API, including...\n",
    "    - Method: type of query made using language defined by the API\n",
    "    - Parameters: refine the query\n",
    "- Response: data returned by API, typically in a common format like json\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of API Queries: Wikipedia's API\n",
    "- Wikipedia's API doesn't require an authorization key\n",
    "    - When required, since scrapy can handle authorization so it can be used to access APIs\n",
    "- Goal: use [Wikipedia's API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to get what other entries on Wikipedia link to the Monty Python page\n",
    "    - To do this by scraping, would have to scrape every single page on Wikipedia (very inefficient)\n",
    "    - To accomplish this, can build a query using the [Wikipedia API Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox)\n",
    "    - Query is: `https://en.wikipedia.org/\n",
    "    w/api.phpaction=query&format=xml&prop=linkshere&titles=Monty_Python&lhprop=title%7Credirect`\n",
    "    - Broken down:\n",
    "        - `w/api.php`: tells the server we are using an API rather than scraping raw pages\n",
    "        - `action=query`: want information from the API (as opposed to changing information in the API)\n",
    "        - `format=xml`: return format in xml, then we will parse with xpath\n",
    "        - `prop=linkshere`: we are interested in which pages link to target page\n",
    "        - `titles=Monty_Python`: setting target page using exact page name\n",
    "        - `lhprop=title`: from those links, want the title of each page\n",
    "        - `redirect`: also want to know if the link is a redirect\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Using Scrapy for API calls\n",
    "- If query can be answered in one response, scrapy is overkill\n",
    "    - Can just use requests library to make call and library like lxml to parse the return\n",
    "- Wikipedia's API will only return ten items at a time in response to a query (to avoid overwhelming the server)\n",
    "- Can use scrapy to iterate over query results (same way iterate over pages when scraping)"
