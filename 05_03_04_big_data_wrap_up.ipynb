    "- No code has been written this section for three reasons:\n",
    "    1. Functionally, the code to build these systems is generally outside the scope of data science\n",
    "    2. Hundreds of cores/drives required to use Hadoop or Spark as intended\n",
    "        - Typically using cloud computing like AWS\n",
    "    3. Data science is more concerned with using these systems rather than architecting them\n",
    "        - Stacks are largely unstandardized and have a large range of possible tools and implementations\n",
    "        - Until working with a specific big data implementation, focus on understanding why the tools exists and what they do\n",
    "        - Learn to use specific tools as needed rather than abstractly"
